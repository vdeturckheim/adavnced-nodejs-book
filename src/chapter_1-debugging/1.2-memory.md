# Using the memory tab

Now we know how to connect the Chrome DevTools to a Node.js instance, we want to
use them to troubleshoot memory related issues.

> It is worth noticing that this part (and the following one) describes tools
that can be used in any V8-related context. This means that it will work in for
Front End applications on Google Chrome or even on Deno.

The "memory" tab of the Chrome DevTools, allows us to inspect what happens in
V8 in term of memory. We can either:
* collect a heap snapshot
* collect memory-allocation-related information
